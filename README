README:

Compiling and running code:
Four subdirectories:

  1.  C: 
      Makefile: compiles all code with make command.
      To run the different sorts type in the sort you want to run and as a parameter the test file in the rand subdirectory. Example : "heapsort ../rand/10000"

  2.  Haskell:
      Makefile: compiles all code with the make command.
      To run the different sorts use the same process as for the C subdirectory.

  3.  JS:
      To compile and run the different sorts type in node sort test file.
      Example: "node quicksort.js ../rand/10000"
